# Today: Go With The Flow
Bugs. Errors. You know what you asked the program to do, but it didn't work. As much as we like to think the computer has made a mistake, odds are the code is not doing exactly what you intended. `Code debugging` is a huge part of software development â€“ `it is the systematic process and tools used to identify where the erroneous logic lies`. Solving these problems quickly and effectively will allow you to be more productive and lower your stress levels!

Today we're going to be learning about some of the gotchas that you'll encounter when working with JavaScript. We'll also learn more about debugging in general, including how to read a `stack trace`.

Meanwhile, we'll also continue our focus on F.O.C.A.L., concentrating mainly on Functions, Arrays, and Loops. Just like yesterday, some of the exercises today will add functions to our Lotide project.

# Are you putting in the hours?
Bootcamp is the type of program where what you put in is what you get out. Therefore, putting in the hours is an *absolute* requirement.

If you're completing all the core work early, there is stretch work to move on to. If both the core and the stretch work is finished, you can `move ahead to tomorrow's work`. Compass unlocks one week at at a time, for this reason.

If completing the core work takes you until 9PM each day, that's totally okay and expected! Stretch work is in place to have more to do if you're done early but is not required if you've got your hands full with the core work. Focus on your progress and pushing yourself to your limits.

If you find yourself leaving the space earlier than 9pm, it's time to seriously ask yourself: `am I pushing myself enough`? Can I do more? How can I replenish my energy so that I can get another hour of focused work in?
