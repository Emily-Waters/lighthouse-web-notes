# Today: JavaScript Objects
Today we will cover a fundamental type of data structure in JavaScript known as an `Object`.

All of JavaScript is designed around `Objects`. An `Object` is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value:
```javascript
const myObject = {
  key: "value",
  anotherKey: "another value"
};
```
The above code is `Object` literal syntax, which we use to represent `Object`s directly in JS code.

Practically every programming language makes use of **key-value** collections, and they go by many different names. Ruby has the Hash type, Python has dictionaries, Java has Hashtable and HashMap.

Different languages will implement `Objects` in different ways, but they all have a data type to store key-value pairs. JavaScript takes things a step further, as virtually everything is derived from `Object`. Almost everything.


# Revisiting the 5 rules
Today is day three of Bootcamp, and therefore it's likely that you have already begun to forget the `5 Rules of Success` here at Lighthouse Labs. Fret not! We are here to remind you of a few important ones:

## Ask for Help 
 If you are stuck for `15 minutes` or more, it's time to hit the Request Assistance button. If you know that you're the type of person who likes to figure things out on your own, just remember: `mentors are not only here to help you on what you don't understand, but they are also here to teach you how to approach problems and how to think as a developer`: things that you will sorely miss out on if you aren't asking for help.

## Take breaks 
You now know that Bootcamp is challenging and all-consuming, but it's important to remember that bootcamp is a `marathon`, not a `sprint`. Go for walks, stretch, doodle, meditateâ€¦ research has shown that mental breaks can boost retention, increase productivity, replenish focus, and encourage creativity.

## Don't Compare Yourself to Others 
By now you've probably noticed that this is arguably the most difficult rule to follow because we are all human. Therefore it bears repeating that the only standard that you will be measured against is ours, and the only person you need to be better than is yourself yesterday. If you find yourself comparing yourself to others, remember that while they may be excelling this week, it could be your turn to excel next week. Instead of comparing yourself to others, work together, collaborate, and pull each other up as a cohort.
