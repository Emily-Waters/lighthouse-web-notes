# This Week: Focus on FOCAL

Welcome to your first week as a web development student at Lighthouse Labs.

This week we will learn some serious JavaScript and also how to think like a software developer. We'll focus on how to solve problems using JavaScript and Node, with a heavy emphasis on debugging, best practices and testing our code. Technical topics will mostly be limited to `F.O.C.A.L.`, an acronym we use here to describe the core concepts of programming that lay the foundation for everything else.

```
F - Functions.
O - Objects.
C - Conditionals.
A - Arrays.
L - Loops.
```

While the prep course introduced these concepts, this week will focus on using them effectively and collectively in order to solve interesting programming challenges.

# Today: Think Like a Dev
Today's goal is to learn strategies for how to take real world problems and turn them into code. You'll use some of the knowledge you acquired in the prep work but go deeper and solve more advanced problems.

We also start our very first project today! A project involves building a clear deliverable and takes multiple days to progress through. Some of our work today (and this week) will be focused on the project, while others will have us stepping away from it.

This week aims to strike a balance between project and non-project work.

# A Note on Lecture Notes
Please check your email for Lecture Notes sent by the instructors soon after a lecture or breakout. It will contain a summary from the instructor (in their words) on what was discussed.

We encourage you to read each one as a refresher. They may include things that the instructor didnâ€™t get a chance to mention in the lecture/breakout itself, like follow-up tasks or links to external resources.

You can also view the notes in Compass, within the lecture/breakout activity, once they've been posted.
